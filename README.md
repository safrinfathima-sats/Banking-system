# Banking-system
A menu-driven banking system written in C++.
This is a beginner-friendly, menu-driven banking application developed in C++. It allows users to deposit money, withdraw funds with balance validation, and check the current account balance. The program simulates a simple banking environment and continuously presents a menu until the user chooses to exit.
The project demonstrates the use of variables to manage account data, loops for menu repetition, switch-case statements for user choice handling, and conditional statements for transaction validation.
It is an excellent project for practicing C++ fundamentals, user interaction, and basic problem-solving skills.
## Features
- Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance
- Motivational messages on deposit (encourages saving)
- Warning alert when a withdrawal is >= 50% of current balance
- Transaction history saved to `transactions.txt` (can view from the menu)
